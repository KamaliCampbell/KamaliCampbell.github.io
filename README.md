## Intended Audience 

The Camp China Website is aimed at travelling young adults aged 18-25 who want to work and help the local community. You don't need a lot of experience to join Camp China becuase you'll be learning new skills and making money simultaneously. There are many opening roles for people with specific skills like cooking or coaching.

## What are you doing? 

- Create a website for a company called Invasion
- Create a camp website for China
- Create least 5 pages including Home, About us, Gallery, Travel and Shop for a website
- Develop using a doctype, box model, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive website, Github hosting and meta tags
- Create 8 sketches on paper and 8 designs on computer using Photoshop for mobiles and tablets
- Designs must include tables, forms with buttons and check boxes, navigation menu, interactive components, colour schemes, embedded multimedia, accessibility features and platform compatibility

## What are you aiming to achieve? 

I am aiming to create a website that:
- is user-friendly
- is consistent and flexible on multiple devices
- has a slide show and a background video on China landscapes on the gallery page
- has an easy navigation system with a vertical design that differs from other website
- creates unique designs on paper and Photoshop
- I can create before the deadline

## Constraints 

There's a lot of contraints that can occur like not having the right resources such as photoshop. When I was creating my design on photoshop, I could have only done it at college becuase I didn't have the software on my laptop. Another constraint is the internet access as we have to do a lot of research through the internet. Another constraint is time as the deadline for this project is December 21st and there are a lot more to do other than coding and designing the website it self. I also have to get feedback from others and write a final evaluation. A personal constraint for me is using JavaScript. I find it difficult to understand JS. It's very important to add JS to my website because it adds a lot of interactivity to the website. 

## Benefits 

The benefits I have for this project is learning the knowledge of HTML and CSS which allows building a website from a scratch. Another benefit is the usage of Photoshop as knowing the basics of Photoshop can help with the designs of my website. Designs are very important basis of my website. Same goes for the designs on paper. I have the basic tools like rulers and pencils to help me sketch my designs on paper. Another benefit for this project is getting feedback from other people that I can apply.

## Nature of Interactivity

It's very important to add interactive features on my website because that's what make a website good. So far, I've added a background video and a slideshow. I am planning to add an "apply now" button which will allow quick access for the user. Instead of going to another page, a box will pop up on the same page.
