# Documentation 

## Intended Audience 

The Camp China Website is aimed at young adults aged 18-25 who wants to work and help the local community. The intended audience is mainly  travellers. You don't need a lot of experience to join Camp China, because you will learn new skills and make money at the same time. There's a lot of job roles to choose from. So any audience that have a specific skill like cooking or coaching can easily join. 

## What are you doing? 

I have to create a website for a company called Invasion. I am going to create a camp website for China. I have to make a least 5 pages, the pages I have created are Home, About us, Gallery, Travel and Shop. In the development stage, I have to include a doctype, box model, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Linking HTML and CSS, Responsive website, github hosting and meta tags. I also have to create designs and in the design stage I have to create 8 sketches on paper and 8 designs on computer (photoshop). I must also include mobile and tablet designs. In the designs, I must include tables, forms with buttons and check boxes, navigation menu, interactive components, colour schemes, embeded multimedia, accessibility features and platform compatibility. 

## What are you aiming to achieve? 

I am aiming to make the website very user-friendly. I am trying to make my website easy to navigate around. I want my website to be consitent and flexible meaning you can also go on your mobile phones and tablets. I want my navigation menu to be very different from other websites. I'm going to make my navigation menu vertical and on the gallery page, I am going to add a slide show and a background video on China Landscapes. I am aiming to create unique deisgns on paper on photoshop and most importantly, I am aiming to meet the deadline. 

## Constraints 

There's a lot of contraints that can occur like not having the right resources such as photoshop. When I was creating my design on photoshop, I could have only done it at college becuase I didn't have the software on my laptop. Another constraint of resource is accessing the internet, we have to do a lot of research and most research is from the internet. Another constraint is time, the deadline for this project is December 21st and there's a lot to do other than coding and designing the website it self. I also have to get feedback from others and write a final evaluation. A personal constraint for me is JavaScript, I find it difficult to understand JS. It's very important to add JS to my website because it adds a lot of interactivity to the website. 

## Benefits 

The benefits I have for this project is having the knowledge of HTML and CSS. This is very important because without HTML and CSS, I won't be able to build a website from scratch. Another benefit is the usage of Photoshop, knowing the basics of Photoshop can help with the designs of my website. Designs are very important because I have to base my actual website on them. Same goes for designs on paper, I have the basic tools like rulers and pencils to help me sketch my designs on paper. Another benefit for this project is getting feedback from other people. This will help me a lot because I will be able to improve my website from the feedback. 

## Nature of Interactivity

It's very important to add interactivity features on my website because that's what make a website good. So far, I've added a background video and a slideshow. I am also going to add a apply now button, this is very important ofr the because it's quick access for the user. Instead of going to another page, a box will pop on on the same page the user's on. This is a good interative feature for many users.
